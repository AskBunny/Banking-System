System allows employees or users to login on the online platform to create a client's account with a different account option.

## Description

- A banking system has been created which allows users to create bank accounts for customers, and allow them to do banking transactions.

- When the user starts the system, it gives an option to choose either employee or customer. The employee has different rights, as he can open a new account for customers and choose the account type whereas customers can directly login and do the required transaction.

- The system also authenticates the employee with a valid user id and password so that a third person cannot login to the system.

- A new user feature allows customer to create a new account for customer, where he has to put customer’s personal details and chooses the account type, after that it allows him to deposit amount there itself or can proceed without depositing the money.

- System creates a text file with all the customer’s details for future reference and whenever an employee or customer changes anything in the account it gets updated.

- Employees can also access the account of the customer to update details, deposit money or create another type of account for the same customer. For that, he has to mention valid user id of the customer, in case he doesn’t, he will be asked again to mention correct user id
